# Information collector for debugging

*Status: In review*
*Feature owner: @tmdzk*
*Feedback requested from: @apad*
*Last Updated: 10/26*

## Summary

As magma is open source it's deployed by developers/companies all across the
globe and on different type of hardware/machine. Core maintainers help as much
as they can in order to help people using/deploying magma. However sometimes
some misconfiguration, bugs happen. In order to speed up troubleshooting we
would like to make a simple tool that the user can run on every single Component
of magma in order to share with the community the current status of their
infrastructure/deployment/software.

## Motivation

When a contributor is seeking for help on the community mailing list or slack,
they usually copy paste logs or just throw the error message. Most of the time
this message is not enough in order to help/troubleshoot with them. We want to
create a tool that will gather all information needed in order to give the
context/logs/system information


## Goals

Create a simple "issue" template like we use on
[magma's github](https://github.com/magma/magma/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=)
